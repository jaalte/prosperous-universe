Recipe handling
- Minerals need to have pseudo-recipes created for them

Market calculation
- Implement a way to specify goods that can be reliably bought/sold on the LM
- Treat credits as a crafting resource (eg NCC: 35)
 - Should streamline cost of goods as well as crafting fees
  - Add recipes for [bid amt] NCC -> [any resource]
  - And for [ask amt] NCC -> [any resource]
  - Then can easily compare input and output NCC
