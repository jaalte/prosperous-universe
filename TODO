Recipe handling
- Minerals need to have pseudo-recipes created for them

Market calculation
- Implement a way to specify goods that can be reliably bought/sold on the LM
- Treat credits as a crafting resource (eg NCC: 35)
 - Should streamline cost of goods as well as crafting fees
  - Add recipes for [bid amt] NCC -> [any resource]
  - And for [ask amt] NCC -> [any resource]
   - Might be fiddly with local markets as supply isn't guaranteed.
    - Maybe just assume if it can be produced via only 1 pioneer recipe on-planet it will be available?
    - Best to assume market rate rather than adjusted price 
  - Then can easily compare input and output NCC


- For each recipe:
 - ~~Determine max that can be produced per hour based on building capacity alone~~
 - Determine max that can be produced with every input as a bottleneck
 - Determine true max based on minimum of the above, which will be used in #2 to determine max of further products
  - Note: Does not factor in the ability to get resources from multiple sources (eg buying LST to make up for deficit in mining rate)

 - Determine minimum cost in NCC based on inputs


 - Count number of workers needed for building
  - Constant for worker needs: dict of resources consumed per worker per hour
