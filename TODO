Recipe handling
- Minerals need to have pseudo-recipes created for them

Market calculation
- Implement a way to specify goods that can be reliably bought/sold on the LM
- Treat credits as a crafting resource (eg NCC: 35)
 - Should streamline cost of goods as well as crafting fees
  - Add recipes for [bid amt] NCC -> [any resource]
  - And for [ask amt] NCC -> [any resource]
   - Might be fiddly with local markets as supply isn't guaranteed.
    - Maybe just assume if it can be produced via only 1 pioneer recipe on-planet it will be available?
    - Best to assume market rate rather than adjusted price 
  - Then can easily compare input and output NCC
